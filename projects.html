                        <p>I have always wondered what goes into web development, so I decided to make this website as a starting 
                            point. Throughout this project, I've taught myself the basics of HTML / CSS programming, along with some 
                            visual design based on the device used to view the website. </p>

                        <h3>Posture Correcting Smart Back Brace</h3>
                        <p>The capstone design project for our class was to design a prototype for a product that used shape memory alloys to solve a day-to-day issue.
                           My group and I decided to try to sovle the issue of poor posture. A smart back brace was designed to be overlayed on a skin tight shirt. The prototype used 
                           3D printed plastic mounts that were sown to the shirt. After consulting with a specialist, the 3D printed parts were attached to be placed in 3 strategic
                           zones on the back to allow for maximum pressure on the back while maintaining a minimum possiblity for injury. A heat resistant tube was run between the parts,
                           and the shape memory alloy was placed within the tube. A sensor array was also sewn into the shirt in a cross pattern to capture the arch of both the spine 
                           and the shoulders. The sencory input and shape memory alloy actuation was done via an Arduino and programmed using the Arduino IDE. This project exposed me to a 
                           really cool material to work with, being the shape memory alloys themselves. It also introduced me to creating 3D models which where then printed for 
                           actual use on the prototype.</p>

                        <h3>Automatic Recycling Robot</h3>
                        <p>The robotics design project for our class was to design an automanomous automatic recycling robot that would complete a series of tasks within
                            a course created by our professor. The robot was designed to use both image and light sensing to navigate around the created room. SolidWorks was used to 
                            model and design the entire robot assembly prior to building it as a requirement of the project. An arduino was used to handle all of the sensory input and 
                            subsequest processing and logic. The arduino also drove several DC motors to move the robot around the room, along with moving the recycling gathering and 
                            depositing mechanisms. Ultimately, our robot did not end up funcioning, but it was a good learning opportunity and it introduced me to a a larger scale
                            SolidWorks assembly. The programming of the robot was done using the Arduino IDE.</p>

                        <p>The first year design project was to design a product that could help someone with a disability during their day-to-day life.
                            A prototype for an in-car alert system that would tell the user via voice clips what color 
                            stoplight they are driving up to. This product was designed to aid someone with a visual impairment. The prototype consisted of 2 Arduino boards
                            equipped with infra-red sensors to be able to communicate the stop light color to the in-car portion. Programming of the system was done
                            using the Arduino IDE software.</p>
